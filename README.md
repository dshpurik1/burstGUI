This application uses Python's Tkinter to create a GUI interface for the API calls.

Some of the libraries that will need to be installed are (include 'py -m' if on Windows):
  pip install Magic-bin
  pip install requests
  pip install pillow

Once those are installed, running the program should prompt with a login page where you must already be a user that can use their credentials to access the SDZ.
The dictionary template must be already uploaded in order for anything to work. 

This is still very buggy with many things that need to be worked on and honestly should've been done on a full stack application rather than all in Python.
